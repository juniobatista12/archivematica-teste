Test files generated from OpenOffice 3.2
========================================

These are a set of test files generated from OpenOffice 3.2.

Simple
------

Starting with simple.odt, I used OOO to generate some variants using basic settings:

* simple.pdf
* simple.xhtml
* simple-PDFA-1a.pdf

I also explored some of the password/encryption features:

* simple-open-password.pdf: Requires a password to open.
* simple-open-nocopy-password.pdf: Requires a password to open, and the 'copy' right is restricted.
* simple-password-copy.pdf: Encrypted (with default password of ""), no rights restrictions.
* simple-password-nocopy.pdf: Encrypted (with default password of ""), and the 'copy' right is restricted.

Furthermore, I took the simple PDF generated by OOO and annotated it in Adobe X.
* simple-annotated-in-adobe-x.pdf
