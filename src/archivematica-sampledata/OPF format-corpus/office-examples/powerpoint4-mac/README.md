Original files are PowerPoint 4. (application/vnd.ms-powerpoint; version=4.0)

Files ending '2001.ppt' were converted to the newer binary format using PowerPoint for Mac 2001 (on OS version 10.2.8, 800 MHZ PowerPC G4). See below.


Migration of PowerPoint for Mac 4 files
---------------------------------------
 
Chris Rusbridge has a collection of .ppt files created several years ago with Office for Mac 4 and has found himself unable to open these files to assess their personal value.
 
Coincidentally, in the course of my recent research as The National Archives’ File Format Signature Developer, I looked at Office for Mac formats, and found that, while Excel and Word documents had a common format with their Windows counterparts, PowerPoint files versions 3 and 4 did not.
 
At The National Archives, we hold a sizeable software library and a 2000~ era iMac running OSX (OS version 10.2.8, 800 MHZ PowerPC G4), so, as an exercise in file format migration, I decided to attempt to make these files readable. The trade-off is that this provides me with some real samples of PowerPoint for Mac 4, from which to attempt to derive a format signature.
 
I installed PowerPoint for Mac 2001 and attempted to open the files. The application briefly displayed a message along the lines of ‘Updating from earlier version’. Once complete I then saved the files as native Office for Mac 2001 .ppt, which my research suggests is identical to the Windows .ppt 1997-2003 versions
 
I then transferred the files to my Windows XP system, running Office 2007, and found that the files were able to be opened fully.
