filesys-trials
==============

A home for mostly empty files.  The idea is to collect the files, file paths and names that tend to break tools. There's an empty file, GitHub doesn't support the empty dir. I'll be structuring as I go, the names and folder structures should be descriptive, but feel free to add your own collections sub-collections.
 
If a particular file name or path upsets a piece of software, put an example here. The current homes are:

a-bad-name
----------

Bad file names and extensions, NOT paths go here.  The place for character-set issues, wierd characters, unconventional use of period, long names, short names, you get the idea....


a-bad-path
----------

Like the name says, a home for all path related issues.  Long paths, silly characters, and so on.  There may be some issues with GitHub accepting certain names and paths but we'll see.
