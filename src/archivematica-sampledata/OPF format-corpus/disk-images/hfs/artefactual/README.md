# HFS Disk Images

Created for the OPF Seminar 'Creating File Format/System Signatures for Submission to PRONOM Technical Registry: Parts I & II'

## Information 

Hierarchical File System (HFS) is a proprietary file system developed by Apple Inc. for use in computer systems running Mac OS ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_File_System)). 

Images included below were 3.5" disks formatted in Ubuntu using [Gparted](https://linux.die.net/man/8/gparted) and then imaged using [DD](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dd.1.html). HFS support is added to Ubuntu using the command:

    sudo apt-get install hfsplus hfsutils hfsprogs
